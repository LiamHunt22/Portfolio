# My Python Portfolio

For this portfolio, I chose to include professional and personal examples that showed my familiarity with python, particularly with its data-parsing capabilities. I chose examples from larger projects to show my ability to navigate complex structures and interconnect frontend and backend components.

The files I included showcase my ability to work with many libraries (including data analysis packages such as keras and pandas). 

## Contents

### 1. json_to_psql.py

**Background**

This file is from a personal project. This project is an API that pulls data from a locally hosted PostGreSQL server to display basketball statistics on a webpage (specifically, graphing shots taken and made during a game onto a basketball court diagram). The json_to_psql.py file is from the backend of this project, and involves the transportation of data from a JSON file to the PostGreSQL database.

**Includes:**
- File I/O and JSON parsing
- Database interaction using psycopg2
- Data validation

### 2. read_pcap.py

**Background**

This file is from CS Research that I completed last summer here at Whitworth University. Our research was presented at the INTG 2025 conference in April. I have included a manuscript of the paper, as it has not been published yet. This project is meant to showcase my ability to parse especially large datasets and analyze data that is in an unusual format.

**Includes:**
- Packet manipulation using scapy
- Packet inspection and filtering by protocol
- Packet-based analysis
